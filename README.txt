This is a very simple module that allows you to disable Javascript and CSS
aggregation on a per module basis. Also works on file files in the /misc folder
as well as libraries.

TO USE:
Enable the module then navigate to /admin/config/development/killagg to select
which items to disable aggregation on.

This module is intended for use on development sites only and for troubleshooting
conflicting coding issues. Use on production sites is highly discouraged.
